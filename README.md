# Electoral archive

This is is an electoral archive with the results of the elections in Colombia. The data is stored in Estuary (https://estuary.tech/), a decentralized database built by Protocol Labs (https://protocol.ai).

It currently has the E-14 forms of the 2018 legislative elections. We are working to continue adding more data.
